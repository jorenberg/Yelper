Vector Space Model - TF-IDF
============================
Machine Learning :: Text feature extraction (tf-idf).
------------------------------------------------------------------
In information retrieval or text mining,
the term frequency â€“ inverse document frequency (also called tf-idf),
is a well know method to evaluate how important is a word in a document.
tf-idf are is a very interesting way to convert the textual representation
of information into a Vector Space Model (VSM), or into sparse features.
